===============================================================================

Redirections:
	Only the last file will be used for redirections. All the files will be
	checked for related permission.

Builtins:
	If builtins are in a pipeline, they will be executed in the forked 
	child processes, which means `exit` and `cd` will have no effect on
	the shell.

Background command:
	'&' could only appear at the end of the last command in a pipeline.
	Background command cannot be terminated by ctrl-c.

Pipeline:
	'|' could not apppear at the beginning of the input.  If '|' appears
	at the end of the input, we assume the input is not finished, and '>' 
	will be printed and user can continue typing the command.

Special characters/strings:
	Only '&', '|', '\n', '>', '<', "$$", and "$?" are treated as special
	characters/strings and will be interpreted.

	Quotation marks will not be interpreted.  For example `"test  test"` 
	will be read as `"test` and `test"`.

Exit status:
	Our program returns EXIT_FAILURE if error occurs during startup, or
	the exit status of the last command if the command terminated normally,
	or 130 if the command is terminated by a signal, or 127 otherwise.

Limitations:
	All the limitations of the input are defined in `sish.h`

===============================================================================

Collaborations:

	We finished the assignment by using pair programming.  We discussed, 
	thought and code together.  We programmed on one computer, one typed 
	and the other inspected.  We switched roles every one hour.

	We met and worked together in the library every evening.  The first
	two days we read and discussed the manual page of sish, figured out
	how to implement the program.  We wrote some test code to test our
	ideas.  We built the structure of the program and began to implement 
	the program on the third day.

	Every day we spent one hour discussing questions, then four hours
	coding.  Each of us got a copy of the code and a copy of the questions 
	we left before we went home.
